
ToDo:

1. While playing video, context menu -> Radio has no effect. Should stop playback and go to radio menu.

2. Add mute button, full screen button

3. When stream is not playable, there is a message sorry can't play, and its dupplicated. After 2xOK it continues to buffer. Should exit instead to menu mode.

4. Dutch channel does not play sound

6. Add Radios.

7. Options of TV/Radio and resolution quality should be dynamic based on actual availability.

8. Localize strings - provide language options.

9. Add "stream filter" button, that would filter and leave only on-line available streams/resolutions.

DONE 10. Display correct resolution and channel when streaming

Possible future features:

- Enable user to add own stations (URL and icons)

- Create interface, that would enable updating streams according to given public GMI stream list

- Possibly extend and store the DB to some SQLite, once simple list is insufficient.
