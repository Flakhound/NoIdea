# TODO's

- [ ] While playing video, context menu -> Radio has no effect. Should stop playback and go to radio menu.

- [ ] Add mute button, full screen button

- [ ] When stream is not playable, there is a message sorry can't play, and its dupplicated. After 2xOK it continues to buffer. Should exit instead to menu mode.

- [ ] Dutch channel does not play sound

- [ ] Add Radios.

- [ ] Options of TV/Radio and resolution quality should be dynamic based on actual availability.

- [ ] Localize strings - provide language options.

- [ ] Add "stream filter" button, that would filter and leave only on-line available streams/resolutions.

- [x] Display correct resolution and channel when streaming

Possible future features:

- [ ] Enable user to add own stations (URL and icons)

- [ ] Create interface, that would enable updating streams according to given public GMI stream list

- [ ] Possibly extend and store the DB to some SQLite, once simple list is insufficient.
